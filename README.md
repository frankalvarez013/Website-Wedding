# Website-Wedding
Responsive website with CSS, HTML, JAVASCRIPT and Bootstrap.
Using the Bootstrap framework and growing knowledge of CSS and HTML, I was able to create a website that was hosted in a heroku server that allowed people to RSVP to the wedding taking place. Using Bootstrap was such an amazing experience because it allowed
me to have so many tools at my disposal such as having responsive classes that consisted of text, images and containers. With my background in art and graphic design (community college class I took in high school), I tried to make the website as aethetically
pleasing by making sure the text was appropriate for the occasion, having colors that complemented each other, and the structure of the pictures, blocks of text neatly organized to reveal what was important to showcase. This project exposed me to a growing 
knowledge of how responsive websites should be tackled since there was two general strategies I though of: creating two whole structures where if the aspect ratio was small, it would display one block of html, and if it was big enough instead it would 
display the other block of code and make the phone version disappeared in the background OR by making sure that every single div or part of the html change when the display was changed. I was able to integrate both layouts when necessary, for example the 
gallery of pictures was responsive or even the text, but because I wanted the phone version to have a completely different look than that of the desktop I thought it was simpler to just create a whole new layout yet still incorporate parts of the responsive
text.
